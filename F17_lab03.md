## Andrew Polk, Victoria Sneddon

## (A)
The project is a simple game of pong. In the game each player has a paddle and they hit a ball between them. If you let the ball get past you then you lose a life or the game.

## (B)
As a user I can open the game program so that I can select play. Then I can select the difficulty and have two players compete. As a user I can control the paddle and can hold the ball using the keyboard. As a user you also have the option to return to main menu and look at the instructions.

## (C)
The software runs, although there are some noticable issues. 

## (D)
As a user I would like to be able to choose the colors of the ball and the paddles, rather than the current flashing colors.
As a user I would also like the paddles and the ball to move smoother.
As a user I believe it would be nice to have sound effects and maybe background music.
As a user I would like there to be an option to play an AI Opponent who is defeatable.

## (E)
The readme could be made easier to read by dividing it up into sections for todo or features already implemented. Currently it is divided by the quarter that is was worked on making it hard to read.

## (F)
The build.xml file could be cleaned up to fix the fomating making it easier to read. It also needs some desciptions added to targets.

## (G)
The issues listed are not fullly comprehensive. Some we will fix, but there are other issues outside of those listed that we intend on fixing. There are definitely enough issues to earn us 1000 points considering all of the possibilities that this game could have. The issues are pretty clear about their expectations.
