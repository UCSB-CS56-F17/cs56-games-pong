a) This repo is a recreation of the game pong where players control a block and try to hit a ball past their opponent.

b) * As a player I can move the block so that I can redirect the ball back. 
   * As a player I can change the difficulty so that I can have a greater challenge and more fun.
   * As a player I can play with a friend so that I can have fun with another person.
   * As a player I can save my highscore so that I can challenge my friends and gain bragging rights.

c) The software does run and the game plays. The difficulty setting doesn't seem to do anything except change the window size and when the ball is hit, it never changes speed.

d) * As a player, I can play against an AI, so that I can play alone. 
   * As a player I can move the block at varying speeds which affects ball travel time, so that the games become more challenging and fun.    * As a difficulty setting, there are obstacles in the middle that can reflect a ball back, so that there is more variance in play and thus a greater challenge.

e) The current quality of the readme file is pretty good. There is a class diagram which clearly shows how each class is connected to one another 

f) The build.xml is working correctly as the program ruins without issues. The build compiles and runs correctly. It has create javadoc as an option, but it isn't listed under ant -p. 

g) There are plenty of issues for us to work on and most of them are pretty clear as to what they expect. A lot of the "issues" are actually just improvements to the game such as adding an AI. That alone could net us up to 700 points.
