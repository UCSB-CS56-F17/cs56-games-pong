a This repo is a recreation of the game pong where players control a block and try to hit a ball past their opponent.

b As a player I can move the block so that I can redirect the ball back. As a player, I can change the difficulty, so that I can have a greater challenge and more fun.

c The software does run and the game plays. The difficulty setting doesn't seem to do anything except change the window size and the ball never changes speed.

f The build.xml is working correctly as the program ruins without issues. The build compiles and runs correctly. It has create javadoc as an option, but it isn't listed under ant -p.
